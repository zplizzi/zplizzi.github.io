Hi! I'm Zack Polizzi. I sometimes work at [Culture Biosciences](https://www.culturebiosciences.com/), and other times hang out at [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com/) where I mostly read machine learning papers. Outside of working, I like to cook, climb, and (recently) play guitar.


One thing I've been studying is AI safety, and I noticed there's not very many good summaries of technical research in the field. To that end, I wrote up a summary of what I've learned so far. [Check it out!](/pages/ai-safety)
